**WHY I MADE RIDE THE REEF**

I made **ride the reef** for my **typography design for page and screen** module that i am currently studying for in my second year at Oxford Brookes university. It is a space to talk and explore typographic design that are in all aspects of life but focussing mainly on products and ideals that have a positive impact on our environment and our reefs.

We are living in uncertain times, our reefs are dying and collectively we need to do everything we can to keep them protected for as long as possible. This blog is going to be used to talk and analyse all ocean related brands that support our planet or brands that share that ethos-

Within this website, the typographical and design choices I have made are all deliberate.
