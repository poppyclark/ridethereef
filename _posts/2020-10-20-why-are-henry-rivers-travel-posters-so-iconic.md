Henry Rivers is an english artist and freelance illustrator well known for his minimalistic travel posters that are sold worldwide.

His posters consistently have the same colour scheme, style and illustration. Each poster looks and feels the same, because of this- his art has become more and more recognisable which has resulted in him becoming more and more popular around the world. 

Typography is so much more than a way to make something look beautiful, it's a vital component of user interface design, successful typography will set the overall tone for a company, a product or anything that involves typeface- which almost everything does.

The typography that Henry Rivers uses two different fonts consistently for the name of each place and the word 'visit' in each print.

The fonts he uses are- Braisetto Thin by Adam Ladd in italic for the 'visit' and Curwen Sans in Bold by K-Type for the name of the place that he is illustrating.

Henry uses the two same fonts in every single travel poster and illustration that he creates. This consistency has helped his success by making him a recognisable artist that is sought out and remembered for his niche travel art.

These fonts make an ideal middle ground for all genders wanting to purchase his artwork, with one the 'Braisetto Thin in italic' being feminine and the Urwen Sans in Bold being masculine. This has logically doubled his market demographic as the posters are unisex, neither particularly manly nor feminine.

The Braisetto Thin is a smaller, more petite font, with thin and curly ends, whereas Urwen Sans in Bold is thick and straight edge- If he were to have just used the Braisetto font his market would've been geared more towards females and would therefore not be so popular.

His choice of font might seem insignificant, but it plays a huge role in how successful his artwork has become. 

His choice of consistent font, style of illustration and colour scheme has made him become recognisable and therefore more of a success.  

Each poster comes with the same aesthetic but with different illustrations for each country and place he is trying to capture- I would describe his work as both peaceful and nostalgic, the kind of artwork that can fit easily into any home.
