Henry is a freelance, full-time illustrator, living in France. His vintage-like, minimal travel posters are an effect of a time consuming and a very consequent work on his style.

His posters consistently have the same colour palette, style, illustrations and fonts which is something that gives him an edge in the market, because of this his work is easily recognisable and has since become popular, which has made him millions. He started getting noticed more and more off of pinterest and with each poster comes a different aesthetic based on the country- i would describe them as both peaceful and nostalgic, the kind of artwork that can fit easily into any home.

Henry uses two different fonts consistently for the name of each place and the word 'visit' in each print.

The fonts he uses are- Braisetto Thin by Adam Ladd in italic for the 'visit' and Curwen Sans in Bold by K-Type for the name of the place that he is illustrating.

With his consistent and varied font choice, a wide market was created. His target demographic is very large, with the fonts a nice middle ground between feminine and masculine as he has chosen two to balance each other out. 

The 'Braisetto Thin by Adam Ladd in italic' for the visit holds a feminine touch as it's smaller than the next and is also thin and curly. Whereas on the other hand the font urwen Sans in Bold is more masculine and solid.

If he were to have just used the Braisetto font his market would've been geared more towards females and would therefore not be so popular.
