In 2020 the climate crisis is at the forefront of our minds, we were given a clear reminder just a few months ago that 'The Earth has a deadline' and we have less than 7 years before what we have done to our planet becomes irreversible. 

Three of the largest and most popular ethical environmental charities that have a high impact are- **Green Peace**, **Rainforest Alliance** and **Friends Of The Earth.**

Each of these charities have different aims and branding but all have one thing in common: they want to save our planet while we still can.

**Green Peace** is 'a movement of people who are passionate about defending the natural world from destruction'.Â They are privately funded and are not government owned, leaving them free to confront both the government and corporations who are responsible for the destruction of the natural world.

As a brand they are extremely honest about who and what they are. 

A lot of people support them not only because of their independence but also because they are not afraid to call out governments to stop 'dragging their feet' and bring in radical changes. 

As a brand they present themselves with logos, typography and colour schemes. 

Their logo is the word '**Greenpeace**' in an original font very similar to '**Wimp Out**'. It is in all capitals 

As a core font for their websites they use '**Helvetica Neue**'.
