The Folk Cafe is a small independent cafe located in Bury Saint Edmunds Suffolk. It has a chill atmosphere, covered in plants and fairy lights, they sell a variety of handmade products, coffees and are dog friendly.

The font they use in their logo is '**DIN Next Paneuropean W1G Black'** by Linotype. It is a **bold**, thick typeface in white with a peach backdrop.

They also have used other fonts and logos as 'special additions' to brand themselves-
