How do independent cafes in the UK brand themselves and how do they choose their typography?

![Folk Cafe- Bury St Edmunds (Suffolk)](../uploads/folk-typog.jpg)

The Folk Cafe is a small independent cafe located in Bury Saint Edmunds Suffolk. It has a chill atmosphere, covered in plants and fairy lights, they sell a variety of handmade products, coffees and are dog friendly.

The font they use is 'DIN Next Paneuropean W1G Black by Linotype'. It is a bold, thick font in white with a peach backdrop. 

They also have used other fonts to brand themselves in the past, however they stay with that font for the majority of the time.
