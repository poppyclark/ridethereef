Reef safe suncreams are becoming higher and higher in demand for all age ranges and are being pushed by the millennials who are becoming more and more conscious of their footprint on the planet. 

One of the best things we can do for our planet and our oceans is to leave behind as little damage as possible, suncreams have a huge impact on our ocean, every-time we swim in the ocean with regular store brought suncream on we seep chemicals into the ocean. These chemicals contain nanoparticles that can disrupt coral's reproduction and growth cycles, which bleaches and kills the coral. 

There is a wide variety of choice in 2020, and although each brand have a different ethos they all come in different colours with different fonts in different sizes, shapes and with different logos. 

The first, and one of the most popular in the United States and now in the UK is the brand Sun bum. They have different lines of suncream, each coming in a different colour, light brown, dark brown or white. The typography always stays the same- Bold and with curly longer letters at the end of each 'M' of the 'bum'. The colour of the logo- a yellow monkey with sunglasses on. 

Their ethos is: 

"We care about the planet.

We care about the animals.

We care about our families.

So, of course we don’t use any ingredients that could hurt any of them."

Another popular brand is 'Green People', its recyclable sugar cane packaging is a popular selling point.
